# Aim
The aim of this project is to come up with a useful solution for transport booking in Landmark University

# Problems It's solving
The major problems encountered which the platform is actively trying to solve include:
* **Convenience**: One of the major problems faced when booking is that booking is not 24/7, these prevent students from booking at any time convenient for them. These platform provides the convenience of booking at hostels or even enabling parents to book for their ward
* **Accountability**: documenting transport booking on paper comes with lots of loophole for scamming(intentional and unintentional), also transport providers might also not be equally treated right. This platform removes the middle man from payment processing and booking hence making the process very accountable
